# HiGlass Docs

Documentation for all HiGlass software ([viewer][hgv], [app][hga],
[server][hgs], [docker][hgd])

Simple edits can be made in GitHub. For anything more extensive, build and
preview it locally:

```
uv run build.py
uv run python -m http.server 8000 --directory _build/html
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`.

Docs are built and deployed via GitHub Actions via a
[workflow](.github/workflows/docs.yml).
